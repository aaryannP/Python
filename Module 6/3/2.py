# ï‚· Practical Example 1: How does the Python code structure work?

"""
Python code structure is based on indentation, which defines the scope of loops, functions, and classes.
Indentation is crucial in Python, as it replaces the need for braces or keywords to define blocks of code.
Indentation is typically done using four spaces or a tab, and it must be consistent throughout the code.
For example, in a loop or function, all lines of code that belong to that block must be indented at the same level.
Here's a simple example of Python code structure:
"""
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
greet("World")
